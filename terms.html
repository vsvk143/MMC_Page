        <h2>Terms and Conditions for the "Bill 150+ Dosa Game"</h2>
        <h3>Eligibility to Participate:</h3>
        <p>The game is open to all customers who make a bill of ₹150 or more at our restaurant. The bill can include individual items or any combination of Dosa, Idly, or Maggi.</p>
        
        <h3>Game Overview:</h3>
        <p>Once your bill reaches ₹150 or more, you are automatically eligible to participate in the "Bill 150+ Dosa Game." As part of this game, you have the opportunity to win a free Dosa under specific conditions.</p>
        
        <h3>Conditions to Win a Free Dosa:</h3>
        <p>Upon eligibility, if your order includes a Dosa (whether by itself or combined with other items), you automatically enter the draw to win a free Dosa. If the Dosa is selected as the winning item from your order, you will receive it for free. Only one Dosa will be provided for free per eligible bill.</p>
        
        <h3>Eligibility for Other Items:</h3>
        <p>The game applies to bills that reach ₹150 or more regardless of whether you have ordered Dosa, Idly, Maggi, or any combination of them. Even if you only order a single item, such as multiple dosas or just Idly or Maggi, you are eligible as long as the bill meets the ₹150 minimum.</p>
        
        <h3>Validity of the Offer:</h3>
        <p>This offer is valid only on the day of purchase when the bill of ₹150 or more is generated. The free Dosa can only be claimed during the same visit and cannot be redeemed on future visits.</p>
        
        <h3>Multiple Participations:</h3>
        <p>A customer can participate in the game multiple times by generating multiple eligible bills during the offer period. However, only one free Dosa can be won per eligible bill.</p>
        
        <h3>Exclusions and Limitations:</h3>
        <p>The offer is valid only for dine-in customers and does not apply to takeaway or delivery orders. This offer cannot be combined with other promotional discounts or coupons.</p>
        
        <h3>Restaurant's Rights:</h3>
        <p>The restaurant reserves the right to modify or terminate the game at any time without prior notice. In case of any disputes, the decision of the restaurant management will be final and binding.</p>
        
        <h3>Liability:</h3>
        <p>The restaurant is not responsible for any discrepancies related to eligibility, participation, or awarding of the free Dosa. The free Dosa offer is non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash.</p>
